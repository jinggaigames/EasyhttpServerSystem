The httpserver is not self-developed, but uses nginx as the kernel.
Since it is a nginx kernel, all features and vulnerabilities are the same
This nginx version is nginx/Windows-1.22.1 and will not be updated unless there is a major feature update or bug fix.
(This project will be updated from time to time with nginx vulnerabilities in the vulnerability repository)
